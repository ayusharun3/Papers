# How User Interface Contributed to the Success of Artificial Intelligence

The goal of Artificial intelligence was to replicate human intelligence but the exact definition has altered a little over time, like narrowing it towards specific tasks at a time. It has been used for assistance since the 1950s, like the use of conversational AI like ELIZA, the first “chat-bot” and SHRDLU, which were language parsers that understood natural language, to help us interact with machines. In the 80s and 90s expert systems were used in medical, financial and many other fields to solve complex problems, diagnosis, analysis as well as emulate decision making. However, since the limitations of computing power and hardware, the use of AI back then was not only expensive but also hard to maintain and not user friendly causing it to be used infrequently.

The 2000s were where AI was silently working in the background of some of the most popular areas of technology that were used frequently, like spam filters in email software, and recommendation systems in video and audio platforms, they were not actively assisting us and were lines of code rather than using a user interface for us to directly interact with. Artificial intelligent assistants became more common in around the mid 2010s, but were more of a novelty than something people actually used to assist them in everyday tasks conveniently. Siri and Alexa, two voice assistants made by Apple and Amazon respectively, were the most popular examples of this.

Recently, AI assistants (I’m using the word assistants loosely here) have gained a lot of popularity, like ChatGPT and Gemini, made by Open AI and Google respectively. There are many contributing factors to the growing popularity of AI, like its capabilities and how it performs complex tasks in a short amount of time. However, the way the user interface for these assistants were designed are definitely a large part of how AI became mainstream. One of the most popular ways that we interact with AI is through natural language conversational interfaces like using a “chat” interface to communicate with the AI, which is something we are familiar with since everyone is used to socializing with applications that use chat and text interfaces.

These interfaces also mimic human speech patterns, which is a result of it being trained on human produced text and media, and can also be used to make it seem more natural and relatable, which can make certain people feel more open and comfortable. Chat bots have also been integrated with text editors like using GitHub Co-Pilot with VS Code as well as Cursor, which use models like Anthropic’s Claude, Open AI’s GPT-4, Google Gemini and more. Custom local models can also used to assist with coding. All these advances have changed the way we work, write papers, code and do a lot more things faster. Even people who are not technical or do not want to configure setting up AI through CLI’s and those who do not have access to high performing computers with advance hardware can use AI through their browser and mobile apps, making the use of AI accessible and easy, thus making it mainstream.
